This design shares computation in the spatial and temporal dimension leading to reduced encoding times. The video representation is modeled autoregressively with networks fit on a current group conditioned on the previous group's network weights. We achieve 12X speedups compared to prior video INR approaches while maintaining encoding quality and compression rate.
